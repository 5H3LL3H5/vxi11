vxi11_1.01 - 06/07/2006

Fair few changes since v1.00, all in vxi11_user.c and vxi11_user.h

Found I was having problems talking to multiple links on the same
client, if I created a different client for each one. So introduced
a few global variables to keep track of all the ip addresses of
clients that the library is asked to create, and only creating new
clients if the ip address is different. This puts a limit of how
many unique ip addresses (clients) a single process can connect to.
Set this value at 256 (should hopefully be enough!).

Next I found that talking to different clients on different ip
addresses didn't work. It turns out that create_link_1() creates
a static structure. This this link is associated with a given
client (and hence a given IP address), then the only way I could
think of making things work was to add a call to an
vxi11_open_link() function before each send command (no idea what
this adds to overheads and it's very messy!) - at least I was
able to get this to only happen when we are using more than one
client/ip address.

Also, while I was at it, I re-ordered the functions a little -
starts with core user functions, extra user functions, then core
library functions at the end. Added a few more comments. Tidied
up. Left some debugging info in, but commented out.
